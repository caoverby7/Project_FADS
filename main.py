#Loops
#detectMovement is a loop that contains compareFrames and checks to see if movement has occured if True, executes detectHumanoid
#def detectMovement():
#detectHumanoid is a lopp that contains compareFrames and checks if the source of movement is humoid, rather than a household pet. If True, executes followHumanoid
#def detectHumanoid()
#followHumanoid is a loop that follows the humanoid subject until it leaves view or fall is detected. If humanoid leaves, program executes resetProgram. If humanoid falls, program executes sendAlert
#def followHumanoid()

#Functions
#compareFrames takes the previous frame and current frame and compares them for the above loops
#def compareFrames()
    #We will want to pass the previous frame and current frame into this function. Recursion?
#sendAlert executes if subjectFallen = True. Afterwards, programs executes resetProgram
#def sendAlert()
    #Are we wanting to just make a pop-up message that says "fall detected?"
    #resetProgram()
#Resets all states to default to start in outer "main" loop
#def resetProgram()

#States (Boolean)
#movementDetected = False
